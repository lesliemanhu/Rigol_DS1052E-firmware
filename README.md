# Rigol_DS1052E-firmware
firmware and 100MHz mod for a Rigol scope

NO SERIAL NUMBER CHANGING! Just put USB drive into the scope! 

Checked on my scope. Worked. 

I firstly updated some old firmware to the newest one - non moded
and than flashed firmware once again with that firmware but moded. 

DO IT AT YOU OWN RISK - it is minimal but still

This repository is more like a "helping hand".

Process is very well described here:

Write me if neede.
